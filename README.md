# EUref_vs_petition - Data for map visualizing petitioners as a percentage of electorate
Heat map of percentage of the electorate in favour of a 2nd Referendum, using data from http://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215

Map: https://fusiontables.googleusercontent.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col18+from+1757yVdUA_OrTDWzmzCA0wk6UQZwrG_E3UiO-M0iu&viz=MAP&h=false&lat=54.63355380490777&lng=-3.5469235146484834&t=1&z=6&l=col18&y=2&tmplt=2&hml=KML

Borders represent UK parliamentary constituencies rather than the "counting areas" that were used in the EU referendum.
If you are interested in using the data to create a map of your own, please see How to update.txt for instructions.
